								  A first was achieved for the duration of the first and second academic year. The course consisted of a variety of electrical principles and applications including network analysis, communication systems, applications of programming, further mathematics, practical laboratory sessions, technical report writing, power engineering, and machines and electromagnetics. The laboratory sessions explored the use of analogue and digital communications systems as well as software controlled circuits. As a result of competent technical report writing, I was shortlisted for an internship assessment for National Instruments.<br>

							  At National Instruments, my daily responsibilities involved working with other engineers to help resolve technical challenges that they were facing. This ranged from solving coding and software problems, to troubleshooting hardware and system connections.<br>During my time as an intern, I developed expertise in one of the company’s software products. As a result, I was given the opportunity to teach the subject to other colleagues, visit customers onsite to pitch and demonstrate the product and deliver technical presentations on the topic. In addition, I was involved with larger scale projects that allowed me to control and manage budgets, tasks, people and deadlines.

					<p style="background-color:#3C6E71; color:#ffffff;">I am passionate about seizing opportunities both academically and other wise, and hence I was able to secure a Scholarship for my degree in Engineering at Cardiff University. As a result of my performance at University, my name was submitted to National Instruments as a recommendation. This lead to spending a year in industry working for National Instruments as a Technical Support Engineer.<br>
					<br>
					In my first year of college, I was chosen to take part in a female STEM training activity, which spanned over 3 days. During these days, I was lucky enough to develop my interview skills, my professionalism and learn more about women in engineering and technology.<br>
					<br>
					During my school years, I was a member of the student council for five consecutive years, a year representative in my final year of school, a member of the South Wales Crime Prevention Team and a member of the Children’s Rights group for NPTC. Additionally, I have volunteered for community groups, such as Swansea Community Farm and Dyffryn Clydach Volunteers, as a part of my Bronze and Silver Duke of Edinburgh Awards. <br>
					<br>
					In my spare time, I enjoy extending my knowledge in electronics and software engineering. For example, I built and programmed a mechanical keyboard from scratch. I also have an online portfolio, which I coded using HTML and JavaScript. The portfolio showcases some smaller coding projects that I’ve completed.
